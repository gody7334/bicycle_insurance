# Setup:
1. Please download the dataset and unzip files into 'bicycle' folder then removing zip file.
2. Install packages: pandas, tqdm
3. Run: python bicycle_insurnace.py

# 1. Check missing files: Will fill the missing value later
missing files: 2016-02: {'btp-street.csv'}

missing files: 2016-03: {'btp-street.csv'}

missing files: 2018-11: {'kent-street.csv', 'humberside-street.csv'}

# 1.1 Build Northern Ireland areas and their coordinate.
During data clearning, I discover that Northern Ireland doesn't have LSOA code,
therefore, I used website's information to rebuilt its areas and coordinate.
Area information: https://www.police.uk/northern-ireland/
approximate coordinate: google map

# 2. Load all data into single DataFrame:
stage0-all_df.csv

# 3. Decide the price should base on which attribute
The following files show the crime counts based on different area size.
a.LSOA code:                                  stage1.0-group_by_column_count_LSOA_code_LSOA_name.csv, stage1.0-group_by_column_count_LSOA_code_LSOA_name.png
b.Area which remove last code in LSOA name:   stage1.0-group_by_column_count_area.csv, stage1.0-group_by_column_count_area.png
c.File(Police force):                         stage1.0-group_by_column_count_file.csv, stage1.0-group_by_column_count_file.png
case a. there are more than half of LSOA code crime counts which are less than 5 in this two years period.
case c. the area is too big, which cannot tell the different between different city or county
case b. is the case between case a and c. It has better data distribution.

# 4. The area's coordinate is calculated using the mean coordinate of all bicycle theft crime within this area.
The coordinate is an approximation in order to reduce the search time in this small project.
stage1.1-area_coor.csv

# 5. Check missing value: LSOA code
a. LOSA code is Nan:                        stage1.2-nan_losa.csv
b. LOSA code is Nan, but has coordinate:    stage1.2-nan_losa_with_coordinate.csv
In case b, the area can be recovery using mean coordinate, which is built in step 4.

# 6. Recovery missing area using mean coordinate

# 7. Check missing value: Crime ID
a. Crime ID is Nan:                         stage1.3-nan_crimeid.csv
b. Crime ID and LSOA code is Nan:           stage1.3-nan_crimeid_losa.csv
c. Crime ID, LSOA code, area is Nan:        stage1.3-nan_crimeid_losa_area.csv
d. CrimeID, LSOA code, coordinate is Nan:   stage1.3-nan_crimeid_losa_coor.csv
Case a. I discover British transport police(BTP) don't use Crime ID.
Case b. some LSOA code is empty,
Case c, d, because all case in BTP has coordinate, so all case can find its area

# 8. Duplicate case:
a. Duplicate Crime ID:                              stage1.4-dup_crimeid.csv
b. Check duplicate based on multiple columns value: stage1.4-dup_multi_columns.csv
c. Check again after remove duplicate cases:        stage1.4-remove_dup_multi_columns.csv
case a: I discovery that in some cases have same crime ID, but may be the different cases based on their Month, location and coordinate.
case b: I use more columns ('Crime ID' ,'Reported by' ,'Falls within' ,'Longitude' ,'Latitude' ,'Location' ,'LSOA code' ,'LSOA name' ,'Crime type')
to find duplicate case, these cases can be removed from dataset.
case c: after remove duplicate cases, there are no duplicates in dataset

# 9. Check missing value: LSOA code and coordinate
a. LSOA code and coordinate is Nan:     stage1.5-nan_losa_coordinate.csv
In this case, the only information is file(police force). We will distribute these case equally to coresponding file later.

# 10. Summary monthly crime count based on each area
stage2.0-monthly_summary.csv

# 11. Fill missing value.
As there are missing files, so I need to interpolate monthly crime count based on previous/later monthly crime count.
I ignore missing BTP as it record the crimes cover whole UK. It make it meaningless using historical data to recover its crime count.
The interpolation method is spline with order 1 for the simplicity.
stage2.1-monthly_summary_fillna.csv

# 12. Calculate final monthly bicycle insurace price based on each area using given formula in the email.
I keep the minimum price to 1Â£ if bicycle theft keep decreasing or become 0.
stage2.2-monthly_price.csv

# Discussion:
1. Price in some area are very high. This is caused when the areas are very big. I can be solved by spliting into smaller areas.
2. Some decisions aree based on limited resources(time, computing power, scale of project, avaliable information):
    a. The price results can be improved if I can get(defined) appropriate area boundary, which will be a time consuming task.
    b. Recovering missing area using approximate area coordinate (mean coordainte), which can reduce search time.
3. Alternative solution: For a given location(coordinate), we can calculate the price based on crime counts within a range(radius).
